# Software Technology Experiment 1
* There was actually no technical problems during installation as I already had all the software installed from before.
* To validate that the software development environment was working I simply made a little Hello World program in IntelliJ with the installed JDK.
* Like all the other software, I have used heroku before as well as the cli. Therefore there were no technical difficulties encountered.
* I was not able to completely finish the assignment however. During the "Getting started with java" heroku tutorial, i encountered a problem. When adding the "Papertrail"-addon, I needed to verify my account which involved adding my credit card info. I decided to stop here.
